## Usage Guide

### Adding a Gambling Site

3. Fill in the required information:
   - **Site Name**: A friendly name for the site
   - **URL**: The main website URL
   - **Login Credentials**: Your username and password
   - **CSS Selectors**: Elements for automation (see below)

### Finding CSS Selectors

1. Open the gambling site in Chrome/Safari
2. Right-click on the element (username field, login button, etc.)
3. Select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"
4. Right-click on the highlighted HTML code
5. Select "Copy" ‚Üí "Copy selector"

Common selectors to find:
- Username input field
- Password input field
- Login/Submit button
- Daily bonus claim button

### Additional Navigation Steps

For sites that require navigation to reach the bonus page, use JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "action": "click",
    "selector": ".promotions-menu",
    "wait": 2
  },
  {
    "action": "wait_for_selector",
    "selector": ".daily-bonus-button",
    "timeout": 10000
  }
]
```

Available actions:
- `click`: Click an element
- `fill`: Fill a form field
- `navigate`: Go to a URL
- `wait`: Wait for seconds
- `wait_for_selector`: Wait for element to appear

### Testing a Site Configuration

1. After adding/editing a site, click the "Test" button
2. The bot will attempt to claim the bonus
3. Check the screenshot to verify success
4. If successful, enable the site for daily claims

### Manual Claim All

From the dashboard, click "Claim All Bonuses" to manually trigger claims for all active sites.

## Security Considerations

1. **Change Default Credentials**: Update the admin username and password in `.env`
2. **Secure Your Network**: Only access the bot from trusted networks
3. **Password Encryption**: All gambling site passwords are encrypted
4. **Environment Variables**: Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it

## Troubleshooting

### Can't access from iPhone
- Ensure both devices are on the same network
- Check firewall settings on your computer
- Try using your computer's local IP instead of hostname

### Login failures
- Verify CSS selectors are correct
- Check if the site has changed its layout
- Try the "Test" function to debug
- Review screenshots for error details

### Playwright errors
- Run `playwright install chromium` to ensure browser is installed
- Check system requirements for Playwright

### Environment Variables (.env)

- `SECRET_KEY`: Flask session encryption key
- `ADMIN_USERNAME`: Admin login username
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Admin login password
- `CIPHER_KEY`: Key for encrypting gambling site passwords
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string (SQLite by default)

### Scheduling

The bot runs daily at 9 AM UTC by default. To change:
1. Edit `app/tasks.py`
2. Modify the `hour` parameter in `schedule_daily_claims()`
3. Restart the application

## Production Deployment

1. Use a proper web server (gunicorn):
```bash
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 run:app
```

2. Set up a reverse proxy (nginx)
3. Use HTTPS with SSL certificates
4. Set `debug=False` in `run.py`
